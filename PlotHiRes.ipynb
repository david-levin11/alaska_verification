        "\n",
        "The available models are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**AK HRRR**<br/>\n",
        "**RRFS Control Run**<br/>\n",
        "**NamNest**\n",
        "\n",
        "HRRR data for Alaska is available on AWS back to 2018.  NamNest data goes back to September 2021. RRFS data is sporadic as it is an experimental model but most of the data from 2024 is available on AWS.  Sometimes runs will not be found or be incomplete.  This may cause issues especially with precipitation variables which rely on two timesteps to be available in order to plot properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have the notebook set to plot only a few of the numerous variables the hi-res models output.  If there is a particular variable you would like to see plotted, feel free to let me know and I'll see if I can add it.  Alternatively you are welcome to make a copy of this notebook and play around with adding various improvements!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Update: 9/12/2024**\n",
        "--Added custom zoom areas as well as the ability to create animated gifs.  Let me know if you'd like different zooms or any other features/fields!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Update: 4/29/2025**\n",
        "--RRFS was broken **AGAIN** as the file structures on AWS are constantly changing.  Since Herbie no longer works with RRFS I updated to remove the Herbie dependency for RRFS and tried to make it smart enough to grab whatever files exist for the RRFS evaluation on the AWS S3 bucket.  It's not as many as used to be unfortunately.  Best advice is just to try your date and see if a run exists. If you can find the run on https://noaa-rrfs-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#retro_output_final/ but the script is still not plotting, please let me know.  Also if there are additional fields you'd like to see plotted for the RRFS evaluation, please contact me.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Update: 5/5/2025**\n",
        "--RRFS repo is now missing on AWS so until it is either fixed or brought back RRFS fields will not work.  Will update as soon as more information becomes available.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Update 5/29/2025**\n",
        "--RRFS retro data is now back as are the .idx files.  I did add in a way to get the data using pygrib just in case there are missing .idx in the future but the subsetting should now work.  Also fixed an issue with the winds for the NamNest which was preventing proper display.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Update 6/3/2025**\n",
        "Added the ability to do difference plots for certain elements as well as added 80m wind for RRFS evaluation\n",
